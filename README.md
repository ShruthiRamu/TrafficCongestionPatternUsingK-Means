# Traffic Congestion Pattern Using K-Means Algorithm

Implements a K-means algorithm to find the traffic congestion pattern.

Key Feature :
- Loads the raw traffic dataset which contains the density and speed.
- Using k-means and SSE algorithm finds the centroids and clusters depicting the density and speed pattern.
